Project: Rock, Paper, scissors
For this project, I was tasked with creating a Rock Paper Scissors game that operates entirely through the console, without a graphical interface.

I developed a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using the skills I’ve gained so far, along with additional self-study to incorporate features not yet covered in the course. The project was challenging, but I enjoyed the problem-solving process and learned a lot along the way.
To approach the task, I first planned the logic on paper to ensure the flow made sense. I then wrote pseudocode to identify potential issues before translating everything into working code. When errors arose — and there were plenty — I tackled each one step-by-step, breaking down the problem and finding solutions. I also researched new concepts, such as looping structures, to successfully complete the game.
